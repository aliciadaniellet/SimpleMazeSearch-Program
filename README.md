# SimpleMazeSearch-Program

This project involves the implementation of the Deque, Stack, and Queue data structures, which are then applied to a provided maze search program. The focus of the project is to understand and compare the functionalities of Breadth-First Search (BFS) and Depth-First Search (DFS) strategies, and their application in navigating through custom-created mazes.
